# 🧠 AI-Native Dev Cheatsheet

A tactical reference for modern developers upgrading their workflows with AI — mapped task by task from legacy habits to scalable systems.

This repo is part of **Prompt/Deploy**, where we build real-world, AI-native systems for modern software engineers.

## Why Use This Cheatsheet?

Most devs are using AI for surface-level tasks — autocomplete, quick prompts, debug hints.

But the real power of AI comes when you:

- Design workflows, not just tasks
- Use AI to structure, scaffold, test, and ship
- Build systems that reduce drag, increase clarity, and scale across teams

This cheatsheet helps you move from *piecemeal prompting* to **AI-native engineering** — with practical upgrades for 10 core dev tasks.

## Best Practices
