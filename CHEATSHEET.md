# AI-Native Dev Cheatsheet

Most devs are using AI for surface-level tasks — autocomplete, quick prompts, debug hints.

But the real power of AI comes when you:

- Design workflows, not just tasks  
- Use AI to structure, scaffold, test, and ship  
- Build systems that reduce drag, increase clarity, and scale across teams  

This cheatsheet helps you move from *piecemeal prompting* to **AI-native engineering** — with practical upgrades for 10 core dev tasks.

## Cheatsheet: Task-by-Task Upgrade Map

| Dev Task         | Old Way                                | AI Way                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Planning**      | Start building from vague tickets       | Use AI to surface edge cases, clarify assumptions, and scope flows     |
| **UI Scaffolding**| Manually build components/layouts       | Prompt AI to generate layout or code structure from feature intent     |
| **Architecture**  | Guess folder/component structure        | Ask AI to propose scalable file/org patterns before coding             |
| **Testing**       | Write tests after bugs appear           | Prompt AI to generate test matrices and edge cases before building     |
| **Refactoring**   | Spot code smells manually               | Let AI suggest cleaner async logic, prop handling, and modularization  |
| **Docs**          | Docs skipped or delayed                 | Use AI to draft README, usage notes, and in-code comments              |
| **Debugging**     | Paste stacktrace, Google frantically    | Have AI explain errors and write reproducible regression tests         |
| **Deployment**    | Write PRs and changelogs by hand        | Prompt AI to generate PR body, test notes, and changelog copy          |
| **Onboarding**    | Write setup notes in Notion             | Use AI to create setup scripts, env explainers, and onboarding threads |
| **Team Enablement**| No AI consistency across team         | Share prompt stacks, reuse logs, and level-set with scorecards         |

## Example Prompt Snippets

- "Given this vague ticket, what questions should I ask before building?"
- "Propose a file/component structure for a multi-step onboarding flow."
- "What are the 5 riskiest edge cases for this feature?"
- "Summarize this stacktrace + write a failing test for it."
- "Rewrite this code using better async patterns."

---

## Tips for Rollout

- Share your top 3 most-used prompts with your team  
- Run a scorecard audit to benchmark AI-native maturity  
- Log high-impact prompts — and tag them with reuse scores  
- Use prompt logs as onboarding references, not just notes  
- Reinforce that this is a **living system**, not a finished product
